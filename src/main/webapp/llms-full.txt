- **License**: Apache License 2.0
- **Governing Body**: Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

- **Current Stable Version**: 3.0.0 (released November 10, 2025)
- **Development Version**: 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT

## Technical Architecture

### Runtime Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Runtime Container**: Apache Karaf (OSGi framework)
- **Data Store**: ElasticSearch (currently 7.x)
- **API Protocol**: REST over HTTP/HTTPS with JSON payloads
- **Extension Model**: OSGi bundles, Groovy scripting, JSON descriptors

### Core Components
1. **Profile Service**: Manages persistent customer/visitor profiles
2. **Event Service**: Collects, validates, and processes events from all data sources
3. **Segment Service**: Evaluates dynamic segment definitions against profiles in real-time
4. **Rules Engine**: Condition-action rules that fire when events match conditions
5. **Scoring Service**: Calculates engagement/lead scores based on configurable scoring plans
6. **Privacy Service**: Manages consent, anonymization, data export, and profile deletion
7. **Plugin System**: OSGi-based plugins with JSON metadata for extending conditions, actions, and types

### Data Flow
1. External systems (web, mobile, CRM, IoT) send events to the REST API
2. Events are validated and associated with a profile (identified by cookie, ID, or custom identifier)
3. Rules engine evaluates conditions and triggers actions (update profile, send to segment, etc.)
4. Segments are re-evaluated in real-time when profile properties change
5. Scores are recalculated based on segment membership and event history
6. External systems query profiles and segments to deliver personalized experiences

### REST API Endpoints
- `/cxs/profiles` - Profile CRUD operations
- `/cxs/events` - Event collection and querying
- `/cxs/segments` - Segment management
- `/cxs/rules` - Rules management
- `/cxs/scoring` - Scoring plans
- `/cxs/campaigns` - Campaign tracking
- `/cxs/goals` - Goal tracking
- `/cxs/definitions` - Type definitions
- `/cxs/cluster` - Cluster management
- `/cxs/privacy` - Privacy operations (consent, anonymize, delete)

### Key Concepts
- **Profile**: A persistent record of a visitor/customer with properties, segments, and scores
- **Event**: An action or occurrence associated with a profile (page view, click, form submit, purchase, custom)
- **Segment**: A dynamic group of profiles matching certain conditions (e.g., "visited pricing page AND from France")
- **Rule**: A condition-action pair that fires when an event matches (e.g., "when login event → merge anonymous profile")
- **Scoring Plan**: A set of rules that add/subtract points to a profile score
- **Consent**: GDPR consent record with type, status, and timestamp

## Standards Compliance

Apache Unomi is the **reference implementation** of the OASIS Customer Data Platform (CXS) specification being developed at the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cxs/).

## Privacy & GDPR Features

- Consent management API (grant, deny, revoke consent per type)
- Profile anonymization (irreversible removal of PII while keeping behavioral data)
- Profile deletion (complete removal of all profile data)
- Data portability (export profile data in JSON)
- Server-side DoNotTrack support
- Configurable data retention policies
- Cookie-less tracking option

## Connectors & Integrations

### Built-in Connectors
- **Salesforce CRM**: Bidirectional profile/contact sync
- **MailChimp**: Mailing list and campaign integration
- **Custom Groovy**: Write connector logic in Groovy scripts

### Extension Points
- Custom actions (Java, Groovy)
- Custom conditions (Java)
- Custom property types
- Custom event types
- REST API extensions

## CDP in an AI-First World

AI models and autonomous agents require clean, unified, real-time customer data. Apache Unomi serves as the **customer data backbone for AI-first architectures**:

### Why a CDP Matters for AI
- **Context is everything**: LLMs, chatbots, support copilots, and recommendation engines produce dramatically better results when they have access to real customer context (profile properties, segments, recent events, purchase history). Unomi's REST API (`/cxs/context.json`, `/cxs/profiles`) makes this data available in real time.
- **First-party data advantage**: Third-party cookies are deprecated. Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) restrict data sharing. The most valuable and legally defensible data for AI training and prompt augmentation is first-party data that you collect and control through your own CDP.
- **Privacy-safe AI processing**: AI processing customer data raises serious compliance risks. Unomi's built-in consent management, anonymization, and data deletion capabilities ensure your AI systems only operate on data customers have explicitly consented to share.
- **Real-time feedback loop**: AI-powered personalization requires a closed loop — events feed into profiles, profiles feed into AI models, AI decisions feed back as new events. Unomi's event-profile-rules-segment pipeline processes this in real time.
- **Vendor-neutral architecture**: Unlike proprietary CDPs locked to specific AI providers, Unomi is open source. Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, local/self-hosted models, or custom ML pipelines — all via standard REST/JSON.

### AI Integration Patterns
1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Query Unomi profiles and segments to enrich LLM prompts with customer context
2. **AI agent tools**: Expose Unomi API as a tool for AI agents (e.g., "look up customer profile", "check segment membership")
3. **Predictive scoring**: Feed event streams to ML models, write predictions back as profile properties via rules
4. **Smart segmentation**: Use AI to discover segments from behavioral patterns, create them in Unomi via the segments API
5. **Conversational AI**: Give chatbots access to the full customer journey for context-aware, personalized conversations
