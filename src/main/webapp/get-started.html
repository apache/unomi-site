            <div class="pb-2 pt-2">
              <p>Apache Unomi is a REST server that manages user profiles and events related to the profiles. It can be used to integrate personalization and profile management within very different systems such as CMS, CRMs, Issue Trackers, native mobile application. It was designed to be easy to integrate with external systems, promoting profile sharing and re-use in very different applications.</p>
              <p>Basically the server tracks users using different mechanisms (by default cookies), builds a progressively populated profile and associates events that are performed by a user with his profile. Events may range from a click on a page, to a file being downloaded, a native mobile application button being clicked, or anything that can be sent to the server.</p>
              <p>The server has a built-in rule system that makes it possible to perform any action when an event is collected for a profile. It also has the notion of user segments, making it possible to classify user profiles into dynamic sub-groups, notably to build personalized experiences for specific segments.</p>
              <p>As Apache Unomi is built as an OSGi application running inside <a target="_blank" href="https://karaf.apache.org">Apache Karaf</a>, it is extremely extensible and built to be scalable. For example it is possible to plugin new conditions, actions, or any other service that may be needed such as beacon tracking or push notifications.</p>
              <p>Apache Unomi is also the reference implementation of the upcoming <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cxs/">OASIS Customer Data Platform specification</a> to help standardize personalization of online experience while promoting ethical web experience management and increased user privacy controls.</p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h5 class="project-heading">What is unique about <span class="text-muted">Apache Unomi</span> ?</h5>
            <div class="pb-2 pt-2">
              <p>One of the most unique features of this server is its privacy management features. Using the privacy REST API, it is possible for integrators to build user facing UIs that let them manage their profile, and control how they are being tracked, what data has been collected and even anonymize previously collected data or future data ! Finally there is even the possibility for end-users to delete their profile information completely.</p>
              <p>It is becoming more and more important to address privacy issues correctly, and it is even becoming more and more of a legal issue since a lot of legislation is now appearing in many countries to make sure that userâ€™s right to privacy is respected.</p>
              <p>Of course these possibilities have no default UI inside of Apache Unomi so it is left up to the developers to expose them (or not).</p>

              <li>Install JDK 8 (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a> and make sure you set the JAVA_HOME variable <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/</a></li>
              <li>Download ElasticSearch here : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases</a> (please <strong>make sure</strong> you use the proper version : [7.4.2 for Unomi &gt;= 1.5] and [5.6.3 for Unomi &gt;= 1.3] and [5.1.2 for Unomi &lt;= 1.2])</li>
              <li>Uncompress it and change the <code>config/elasticsearch.yml</code> to include the following config : <code>cluster.name: contextElasticSearch</code></li>
              <li>Launch ElasticSearch using : <code>bin/elasticsearch</code></li>
              <li>Download Apache Unomi here : <a target="_blank" href="http://unomi.apache.org/download.html">http://unomi.apache.org/download.html</a></li>
              <li>Start it using : <code>./bin/karaf</code></li>
              <li>Start the Apache Unomi packages using <code>unomi:start</code> in the Apache Karaf Shell</li>
              <li>Wait for startup to complete</li>
              <li>Try accessing <a target="_blank" href="https://localhost:9443/cxs/cluster">https://localhost:9443/cxs/cluster</a> with username/password: karaf/karaf . You might get a certificate warning in your browser, just accept it despite the warning it is safe.</li>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Start Unomi with Docker-compose !</h2>
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            How to Install docker? Find that here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/</a>
What is docker-compose? Read more on that here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">https://docs.docker.com/compose/</a>
            <h3>Spinning up the docker containers</h3>
              <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                <li>Create a file named docker-compose.yml and paste the contents of <a href="https://github.com/woutersf/unomi-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">this github repository</a> in there. This will give you: (Kibana if you uncomment it), elasticsearch and Apache Unomi</li>
                <li>Use the command 'docker-compose up -d' to start it all. This will download all docker images and up your services.</li>
                <li>Wait for startup to complete</li>
                <li>Try accessing <a target="_blank" href="https://localhost:9443/cxs/cluster">https://localhost:9443/cxs/cluster</a> with username/password: karaf/karaf . You might get a certificate warning in your browser, just accept it despite the warning it is safe.</li>

                <li>With 'docker-compose logs -t -f --tail 2000' you can follow the logs along should anything occur.</br>With 'docker-compose ps' You can then see the status of the containers and see if they are Up or not.</li> .</li>
