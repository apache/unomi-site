            <h2 id="apache-unomi-release-guide">Apache Unomi Release Guide</h2>

            <p>The Apache Unomi project periodically declares and publishes releases. A release is one or more packages of the project artifact(s) that are approved for general public distribution and use. They may come with various degrees of caveat regarding their perceived quality and potential for change, such as "alpha", "beta", "stable", etc.</p>

            <p>The Unomi community treats releases with great importance. They are a public face of the project and most users interact with the project only through the releases. Releases are signed off by the entire Unomi community in a public vote.</p>

            <p>Each release is executed by a <em>Release Manager</em>, who is selected among the Unomi committers. This document describes the process that the Release Manager follows to perform a release. Any changes to this process should be discussed and adopted on the <a href="../community/index.html">dev@ mailing list</a>.</p>

            <p>Please remember that publishing software has legal consequences. This guide complements the foundation-wide <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/release.html" target="_blank">Product Release Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution" target="_blank">Release Distribution Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

            <p><img src="../assets/images/release-guide.png" alt="Apache Unomi release guide" title="Release Process" class="img-fluid" /></p>

            <p>The release process consists of several steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Decide to release</li>
              <li>Prepare for the release</li>
              <li>Build a release candidate</li>
              <li>Vote on the release candidate</li>
              <li>During vote process, run validation tests</li>
              <li>If necessary, fix any issues and go back to step 3.</li>
              <li>Finalize the release</li>
              <li>Promote the release</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="decide-to-release">Decide to release</h2>

            <p>Deciding to release and selecting a Release Manager is the first step of the release process. This is a consensus-based decision of the entire community.</p>

            <p>Anybody can propose a release on the dev@ mailing list, giving a solid argument and nominating a committer as the Release Manager (including themselves). There's no formal process, no vote requirements, and no timing requirements. Any objections should be resolved by consensus before starting the release.</p>

            <p>In general, the community prefers to have a rotating set of 3-5 Release Managers. Keeping a small core set of managers allows enough people to build expertise in this area and improve processes over time, without Release Managers needing to re-learn the processes for each release. That said, if you are a committer interested in serving the community in this way, please reach out to the community on the dev@ mailing list.</p>

            <p>Basically we will be following the procedure described <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html" target="_blank">here</a> with a few more steps and details before and after.</p>


            <h3 id="checklist-to-proceed-to-the-next-step">Checklist to proceed to the next step</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>Community agrees to release</li>
              <li>Community selects a Release Manager</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="prepare-for-the-release">Prepare for the release</h2>

              <h3 id="prepare-source">Pre-flight checks</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>Make sure all copyright years have been changed in NOTICE and any other file</li>
                  <li>Check that all SNAPSHOT versions are correct by searching for SNAPSHOT in all XML files</li>
              </ol>

              <h3 id="prepare-gpg">GPG Key configuration</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      Make sure to have a PGP key for your @apache.org email.
                      if not you can create a new one locally:
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>gpg --gen-key</code></pre>
                  </li>
                  <li>Make sure that your default GPG key is configured to use an signature with an @apache.org email.
                      You can do this by adding the following to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf :
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>default-key &lt;key-uid&gt;</code></pre>
                      replacing &lt;key-uid&gt; with the key uid you want to use by default. You can get the &lt;key-uid&gt; using:
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code></pre>
                      You should then check by signing a file and verifying its signature that you have the right
                      default key:
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>gpg -ab test.txt
gpg --verify test.txt.asc test.txt
                      </code></pre>
                      This should tell you which key was used and display the email address.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Make sure your public KEY is available in this files (if not add your key to the files and commit/push):
                      <ol>
                          <li><a href="https://github.com/apache/unomi/blob/master/KEYS">GIT https://github.com/apache/unomi/blob/master/KEYS (cherry-pick to the branches if necessary)</a></li>
                          <li><a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/unomi/KEYS">SVN https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/unomi/KEYS</a></li>
                          <li><a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/unomi/KEYS">SVN https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/unomi/KEYS</a></li>
                      </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Make sure your public KEY is also available in public pgp server like <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">https://keys.openpgp.org/</a>.
                      You can export your key to file with:
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>gpg --export USERNAME@apache.org > USERNAME@apache.pub</code></pre>
                      Then upload it on <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/upload">https://keys.openpgp.org/upload</a>
                  </li>
              </ol>

            <h3 id="prepare-jira">Jira</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Setup new version in JIRA project</li>
              <li>
                  Update all JIRAs, close the ones that are still not closed, review tickets that can be closed, postpone to another release tickets that are not managed now.
                  You can use this JIRA page: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/UNOMI?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=unreleased">Unomi JIRA releases</a>.
                  Then review the list of tickets that need to be updated, also additionally you can check the list of commits since previous release and insure they are closed using fix version: {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }}.
                  Ideally all tickets listed for version: {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} should be closed or moved to the next version in case they are not finished/started.
              </li>
                <li>
                    Then you can also generate a release notes automatically using: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319220&version=12350150">JIRA release note</a>,
                    By choosing the version: {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }}. It will be useful for linking the release notes in the voting mail.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="manual-release-guide">Automated vs manual release</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>Most of the release steps are now executed through scripts. However if you prefer to do everything
                  manually or are having some problems, you can find the manual release guide <a href="manual-release-guide.html">here.</a>
                  </li>
              </ol>

            <h3 id="prepare-build">Build the project</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Make sure you have a Docker installation properly configured on the machine building the project,
                  as it is required to build everything.
              </li>
                <li>Setup server passwords for publishing as document here:
                    <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html" target="_blank">https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html</a> and <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html#How_to_encrypt_server_passwords" target="_blank">https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html#How_to_encrypt_server_passwords</a>
                </li>
              <li>Launch the first build script using.
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>./release-stage-1.sh {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} BRANCH_NAME</code></pre>
                  where BRANCH_NAME is the branch you want to release (It must be created first if it doesn't exist !).<br>
                  <strong>This step will generate staging artifacts onto the <a href="https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories">Apache Nexus</a>, if at the end of the script the
                  artefacts are not there, something bad happened in the script execution.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Check that there are no JARs or ZIP files in the source code, you can do this by looking at the generated RAT report here :
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>less target/unomi-root-{{ site.data.unomi.next.development.version }}.rat</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>Check that the KEYS file only contains signatures with @apache.org addresses (if there are non @apache.org don't remove them because they have
                been used to sign older releases)
              </li>
              <li>Check the Copyright notice years in the NOTICE file and anywhere else where it might be (by using search and replace)</li>
              <li>If you get JavaDoc errors or other errors you must correct all of them before proceeding further</li>
              <li>If you get a error while signing despite having the proper keys install that looks like this:
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>[INFO] --- maven-gpg-plugin:1.5:sign (default) @ unomi-root ---
gpg: 'echec de la signature : Inappropriate ioctl for device
gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device</code></pre>
                you can either try to sign a file like this:
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>gpg -ab test.txt</code></pre>
                this will ask for your password and remember it in the agent for a while, or if you want a more permanent solution: <a href="https://dan.cx/2016/11/gpg-inappropriate-ioctl-for-device-errors" target="_blank">https://dan.cx/2016/11/gpg-inappropriate-ioctl-for-device-errors</a>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="publish-the-release">Publish the release</h2>
            <h3 id="publish-repository">Repository</h3>
              <ol>
              <li>If something fails, make sure you first drop the staging repository created here: <a href="https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories" target="_blank">https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories</a>.<br>
If you need to relaunch the <code>release:perform</code> and don't have a release.properties, create a <code>release.properties</code> file with the following contents:
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>scm.url=scm:git:https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=unomi.git
scm.tag=unomi-root-{{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }}
and run mvn release:perform</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>Connect to <a href="https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories" target="_blank">https://repository.apache
                  .org/#stagingRepositories</a> and look for the open staging repositories, you should have two (one for everything and the other for KAR/features) for releases &lt;= 1.2 and just one for versions &gt;= 1.3.0 (because of changes in the Karaf plugins). Close the repositories and given a meaningful comment when closing such as:<br>
                <strong>Apache Unomi {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} Release Candidate 1</strong>. If no artefact related to Unomi is present, something wrong happened in <code>release-stage-1.sh</code>.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="publish-vote">Vote</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Launch the second stage of the release script
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>./release-stage-2.sh {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} orgapacheunomi-NEXUS-UNOMI-ID</code></pre>
                  where NEXUS-UNOMI-ID is the ID generated by Nexus for the staging artifacts.
              </li>
                <li>Send out to the Unomi mailing list a mail to start the voting process, see <a href="#mail-1">[1]</a></li>
                <li>If the vote is refused or cancelled, peform the following steps to restart the release process:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Drop the release in <a href="https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories" target="_blank">Nexus</a></li>
                        <li>Remove the tag in Git:
                            <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>git push --delete origin unomi-root-{{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }}
git tag -d unomi-root-{{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }}</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Correct any problems in the source, make sure to do them in master and cherry-pick them to the relevant branches</li>
                        <li>Reset all versions with the following command:
                            <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>mvn versions:set -DskipITs=true -DskipTests=true -P integration-tests,rat,apache-release,docker,\!run-tests</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Restart at the release:prepare step</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
              <li>
                If the vote is refused, you will need to restart the release process. Make sure you remove the staging repositories as well as the release tag. You will also need to reset the version in the project using:
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>mvn versions:set</code></pre>
              </li>
                <li>Send out a vote summary in the same thread to the Unomi mailing list once the voting period has expired, see <a href="#mail-2">[2]</a></li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="finalize-release">Finalize the release</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Move the files uploaded to the unomi-dev repository to the unomi-release repository by doing the following:
                <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>svn mv https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/unomi/{{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/unomi/{{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} -m "Apache Unomi {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} Release"</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                In JIRA mark the version as released and add a release date
              </li>
              <li>
                Connect to <a href="https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories" target="_blank">https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories</a> and look for the open staging repositories, you should have one. Select the staging repositoriy and click on <code>release</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Update the website (in project `unomi-site`) to point to the new release on the download page by
                  first copying the previous archive release and replacing all the version numbers with the current release
                  version. Also don't forget to copy the release notes. Then you can update the download page with the proper
                  links to the new release (no direct links to <code>www.apache.org/dist</code>, make sure you use the closer.lua script).
                  Be careful with links that contain & (ampersand) characters, they must be replaced with &amp;. Normally all
                  this should be easy to do by simply search & replacing the version number. Finally on the home page update the news section to add the release.
                  <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/unomi-site.git</code></pre>
                  Perform any modifications, notably change the versions in the <code>src/main/webapp/_data/unomi.yml</code> file:
                  <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>
                      latest:
                          stable:
                            version: 2.3.0
                          .development:
                            version: 2.4.0-SNAPSHOT
                        next:
                          stable:
                            version: 2.4.0

                </code></pre>
                 Then modify the <code>index.html</code>, <code>download.html</code> to add the new files. For the documentation see the next step or git <a href="https://github.com/apache/unomi-site/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.
              </li>
                <li>
                  Test the site modifications using the generated site HTML using Jekyll serve
                    <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>jekyll serve</code></pre>
                    or by using docker (to not install <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> locally)
                    <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code> docker run --rm \
  --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  jekyll/jekyll:4.2.0 \
  jekyll serve </code></pre>
                    Connect to <code>http://127.0.0.1:4000</code> to check the modifications. With the docker image source changes are detected and site build automatically.
                    This generates the site in the <code>target/site</code> folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the site build, deploy the web site changes using:
                  <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>
mvn install scm-publish:publish-scm -Dusername=YOUR_APACHE_USERNAME -Dpassword=YOUR_APACHE_PASSWORD</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then make sure to commit all the changes to the web site's git project:
                  <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>git commit -m "Apache Unomi {{ site.data.unomi.next.stable.version }} Release website update"
git push</code></pre>
              </li>

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      Before running the manual and API generation tool, make sure to update the versions in the
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>generate-manual-config</code></pre> file to make sure the
                      correct versions are used. You should only have to update the following lines:
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>
# === VERSION CONFIGURATION ===
# Latest version (master branch)
LATEST_BRANCH="master"
LATEST_VERSION="3.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

                      This will perform a dry-run and show all actions without making any changes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Check the generated site by opening <code>target/staging/</code>
                      and verify your changes, ensuring there are no broken links.

                  <li>
                      To publish the documentation to the Apache SVN, run:<br>
                      <pre class="alert alert-primary"><code>./generate-manual.sh publish APACHE_LDAP_USERNAME APACHE_LDAP_PASSWORD</code></pre>
                      This will generate and upload both the latest and stable documentation versions, as well as release packages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Go back to the site project and update the documentation page to link to the correct versions of the documents.

                    Change to the Docker directory. Make sure you have docker running locally (start Docker Desktop for

              <p>
                  In order to lighten the load on mirrors, remove old releases from the dist server once the new release
                  has properly been deployed to all the mirrors. Old releases are automatically archived so they are
                  not needed on the mirrors anymore. Just make sure that all the links in the download page do point
                  to the archive server.

            <p>It is important that we improve the release processes over time. Once you've finished the release, please take a step back and look what areas of this process and be improved. Perhaps some part of the process can be simplified. Perhaps parts of this guide can be clarified.</p>

            <p>If we have specific ideas, please start a discussion on the dev@ mailing list and/or propose a pull request to update this guide. Thanks!</p>
