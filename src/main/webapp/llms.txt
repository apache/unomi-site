# Apache Unomi - Open Source Customer Data Platform

> Apache Unomi (pronounced "You know me") is a Java open source Customer Data Platform (CDP) hosted at the Apache Software Foundation. It manages customer, lead, and visitor data, enables real-time personalization of customer experiences, and provides built-in privacy management including GDPR compliance. It is the reference implementation of the OASIS Customer Data Platform (CDP) specification.

## Key Facts

- **Project**: Apache Unomi
- **Type**: Customer Data Platform (CDP)
- **License**: Apache License 2.0
- **Language**: Java
- **Runtime**: Apache Karaf (OSGi)
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch (9.x); OpenSearch support coming in next release
- **API**: REST/JSON & GraphQL
- **Current Stable Version**: 3.0.0
- **Website**: https://unomi.apache.org
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/apache/unomi
- **Issue Tracker**: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UNOMI
- **Standard**: Reference implementation of OASIS CXS CDP specification

## Core Features

- **Profile Management**: Unified customer profiles aggregated from multiple data sources (web, mobile, CRM, IoT)
- **Event Tracking**: Collect events from any source via REST API (page views, clicks, logins, custom events)
- **Real-time Segmentation**: Dynamic audience segments based on profile properties and event history
- **Scoring**: Lead scoring and engagement scoring with configurable rules
- **Rules Engine**: Built-in rule engine that triggers actions when conditions are met on events or profiles
- **Privacy / GDPR**: Consent management, data anonymization, profile deletion, data portability
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality through OSGi plugins, Groovy actions, and JSON descriptors
- **Connectors**: MailChimp and custom connectors via plugin API (Salesforce connector was deprecated)
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible query API for profiles, events, segments, and rules
- **Multi-backend**: OpenSearch support is in development (committed to main branch, coming in next release)

## Use Cases

1. **Web Personalization**: Track visitors on CMS-managed websites and personalize content based on profile data and segments
2. **Mobile Analytics**: Backend for native mobile apps to collect events, track user journeys, and build profiles
3. **Centralized Profile Management**: Aggregate customer data from CRM, support, commerce, and other systems into unified profiles
4. **AI & Machine Learning Data Layer**: Serve as the real-time customer data backbone for AI agents, chatbots, recommendation engines, and predictive models — feeding unified profiles, segments, and event streams via REST API with privacy-safe consent management

## CDP in an AI-First World

AI agents and language models are only as good as the data they can access. Apache Unomi provides the real-time, privacy-compliant customer data foundation that AI systems need:

- **Context for AI agents**: Feed rich customer profiles, segments, and behavioral event history to LLMs, support copilots, and autonomous agents via REST API
- **First-party data advantage**: As third-party cookies disappear, the first-party data collected through your own CDP becomes the most valuable and trustworthy source for AI training and context
- **Privacy-safe AI**: Built-in GDPR consent management ensures AI systems only process data customers have explicitly consented to share
- **Real-time decisioning**: AI-powered personalization requires millisecond-level context — Unomi processes events and updates profiles in real time
- **Open & vendor-neutral**: Unlike proprietary CDPs locked to specific AI vendors, Unomi lets you connect any AI system (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, custom ML pipelines)

## Getting Started

The fastest way to try Apache Unomi is with Docker:

```

## Architecture

Apache Unomi is a REST server. Data sources (web, mobile, CRM, IoT) send events via the REST API. The processing engine stores data in Elasticsearch, evaluates segments and rules in real-time, and outputs personalization decisions, scores, and data exports. All communication is JSON over HTTP/HTTPS. A GraphQL API is also available for flexible querying of profiles, events, segments, and rules.
