            <h4 class="pb-2 mb-1">Jahia jExperience</h4>
            <p>Jahia is the initial contributor of Apache Unomi and is using it as an engine to integrate content and
                data in their Customer Data Platform (jExperience) and Digital Experience Platform (Jahia) while
                respecting privacy through Unomi's native GDPR support. They are also leading the Customer Data Platform
                specification being worked on at the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. Apache Unomi is the
                reference implementation of that standard.
            </p>
            <p>"Apache Unomi, thanks to its strong foundation in Apache Karaf and ElasticSearch, is a very modular and,
                completely open and performant CDP engine that is a very important foundation of our products. We love
                Apache Unomi, we work hard to encourage others to adopt it, we are here to help and we are deeply committed
                to helping our customers succeed with it." - Serge Huber, Jahia CTO.</p>

            <p>Ninetailed use Apache Unomi to provide a complete view of the visitors; to discover new visitor segments,
                choose from personalization recommendations, so their customers can test their ideas and grow the
                traffic they already have.</p>
            <p>"Apache Unomi was chosen as our CDP due the logical and plugin architecture, because it is an Apache
                Open Source project and specially because of its Privacy (GPDR consent management) features.
                This lets the user own their data, but also marketers and developers improve the user journey to help
                the users in their decision process and brand experience" – Andy Kaiser, Ninetailed founder</p>
