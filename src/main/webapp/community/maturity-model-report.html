          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This is an assessment of the Unomi podling’s maturity, meant to help inform the decision (of the mentors, community, Incubator PMC and ASF Board of Directors) to graduate
            it as a top-level Apache project. It is based on the ASF project maturity model at <a target="_blank" href="https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html</a>
            Maintaining such a file is a new, experimental idea as part of the continuous improvement of the ASF incubation process.
          </p>

          <h3>Status of this document</h3>
          <p>
            Updated 2018-10-09 with the latest status of the project.

          <h3>Overall assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Just introduced this report card, we will need to evaluate all the model’s parts to see how we fare so far.
          </p>
